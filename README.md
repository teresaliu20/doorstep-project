## About Doorstep
Welcome to Doorstep, a platform where community members can share and request free food or clothing items from each other in an attempt to reduce waste. Doorstep provides its community members an open marketplace while encouraging community engagement.

## How it works
Users can sign up for a profile allowing them to join or create communities they would like to be a part of. Within these communities, users can post the name of an item they currently own and would like to give away and a link to a photo of the item. Any other users within this community can click on the item's card on their community page and submit a message to the owner of the item. Community members can also submit requests for items they might need quickly, such as a cup of sugar or a pair of new but unworn jeans.
